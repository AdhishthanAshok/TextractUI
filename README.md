## 📄 TextractUI – AI-Powered Form Data Extraction Tool

TextractUI is an intelligent document processing app that uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and ICR (Intelligent Character Recognition) to automatically extract text and structured data from scanned forms, images, and UI-based documents. Built for developers and businesses, it streamlines data entry by turning images and handwritten content into editable, searchable formats.

### 🔑 Key Features
- ✅ **Multi-Format Support**: Process PDFs, scanned forms, screenshots, and UI-based inputs.
- ✍️ **Handwriting Recognition (ICR)**: Extract handwritten text using AI models.
- 📊 **Structured Output**: Export form data as JSON, CSV, or directly to a database.
- 🧠 **AI-Enhanced Backend**: Powered by OpenCV, Tesseract, and optional ML/ICR via PyTorch.

### 💼 Use Cases
- Automate data entry from invoices, surveys, and application forms.
- Digitize handwritten or printed records for analytics and archiving.
- Extract text from images to enhance accessibility.

### 🧰 Tech Stack
**Python**, **OpenCV**, **Tesseract OCR**, **PyTorch (ICR)**, **FastAPI/Flask**, **React/Vue.js (optional frontend)**
